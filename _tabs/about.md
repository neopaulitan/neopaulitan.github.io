I am a student that's interested in error analysis and puzzle-solving. 
I am currently set to pursue a masters program in chemistry at Postech in 2021.
I graduated with a BSc from UBCO in 2015 with a chemistry major and a data science minor.
There's a lot of anxiety around the future and such, so here's my [transcript] from my undergrad years and here's my [current CV].
